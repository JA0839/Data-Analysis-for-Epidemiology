# Data-Analysis-for-Epidemiology
This repository houses the homeworks and labs that I completed for my Data Analysis for Epidemiology graduate course. This repository is meant to display the SAS techniques that I have learned and utilized throughout my MPH tenure.

Both the SAS code and written report for each homework/lab can be found separately within this repository. Some homeworks/labs may build upon each other.
